# Easy-introduction-to-Options
I will provide a series of papers talking about options, strategies with options, greek letters and so much more, in the same manner in which I would have wanted them explained to me.
For every file, I will provide a pdf and the code written on python to give you the possibility to replicate what I did and play with with it.
